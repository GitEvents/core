# HackDay Reviews

## No.1, January 17

### Participants
- NodeBCN / BarcelonaJS (http://www.meetup.com/NodeBCN/events/219664616/)
- LNUG (London Node User Group) https://ti.to/opensauce/github-api-hackday/

### Communications
- Most of the time was required to settle for an architecture/data structure. That could have been
avoided with some work before the event, but on the other hand the architecture now is a lot better
than imagined before, so the conversation lead to a great goal [@PatrickHeneise]
- 'Only' two people were working on the same issue, could have been avoided. [@PatrickHeneise]
- Constant audio/video line could have improved communications, on the other hand not everyone was
on Gitter as requested or didn't reply [@PatrickHeneise].

Thanks everybody for making this project happen and helping event organisers!
