# HackDay Reviews

## No. 1 - January 17.

### Participants
- NodeBCN / BarcelonaJS (http://www.meetup.com/NodeBCN/events/219664616/)
- LNUG (London Node User Group) https://ti.to/opensauce/github-api-hackday/


### Communications
- One case of two people on two locations working on the same thing, that's acceptable given the amount of stuff we had. [@PatrickHeneise]
- Constant video/audio stream would have been better, we'll improve that next time [@PatrickHeneise]

### Architecture
That was the most difficult part and hard to get all people to agree / on board. But there were some
really interesting solutions and the final product is way better than initally planned.[@PatrickHeneise]

Thanks all!
