## To Do
### ``gitevents.js``
(line 84) : 'talk proposal' contains 'talk', so this should be refactored. Going with 'proposal' for now.


### ``lib/events.js``
(line 53) : what needs updating?


### ``tests/events.js``
(line 221) : remove talk not implemented yet

(line 226) : archive talk not implemented yet
