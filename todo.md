## To Do
### ``gitevents.js``
(line 79) : add raygun.io / sentry / firebase error reporting here.

(line 87) : "talk proposal" contains "talk", so this should be refactored. Going with "proposal" for now.


### ``tests/talks.js``
(line 37) : remove talk not implemented yet

(line 42) : archive talk not implemented yet
